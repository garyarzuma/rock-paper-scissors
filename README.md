# rock-paper-scissors
Rock Paper Scissors game played against the computer. 

This was my first project done using Javascript.

Demonstrated Skills:

    -Used Math.random and Math.floor functions to generate computer move.
    -Used switch statements and if/else if/else statements to code different game outputs depending on player input and the random computer move.
    -Main game loop uses a For loop to cycle through the different rounds of the game before finally displaying final game results. 
    -Uses prompt() function to recieve use input and can accept any capitilization of inputs by running input through toLowerCase() function.
    -Has a default case for invalid user input.
    -Uses console.log() to display game results. 

I will be adding a GUI into the webpage at a future time.

Overall project time: 2 hours
Date Completed: 12/5/2020
